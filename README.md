# GenomeBuildPredictor
Predicts the genome build version of genomic track files, if any of the sequence coordinates in the input track file are unique to a genome build version

### Introduction

This tool builds upon the strengths of existing Bioconductor packages that enable scalable genomic analyses to predict the genome build version of genomic track files.
